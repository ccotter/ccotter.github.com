        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>I am an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin.
        When I graduate in December 2013, I will receive my B.S. in Computer
        Science (with Turing Scholars Honors) and Pure Mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
        I have been working for IBM as an intern since May 2012, and
        starting June 2013 I will be joining
        <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/">Bloomberg</a> for a summer
        internship. You can see
        some of my professional and academic projects I have worked in my
        <a href="coding.html">coding</a> section. I also maintain an active
        presence on Github and host many open-source projects on my account.
        </p>
        <h3>Highlights</h3>
        <p>
        Check out the undergraduate research work I undertook: I spent the
        bulk of three semesters working on the Linux kernel to make
        multithreaded programs deterministic. The end result is my
        undergraduate thesis, <a href="cotter-thesis.pdf">Enforced
          Deterministic Program Execution in the Linux Kernel</a>.
